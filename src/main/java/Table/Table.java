 * This class needs to manage an ArrayList of Entry objects.  It needs a get method that takes a key and returns
 * its corresponding value, or null of the key is not in the arraylist.  It needs a put method that takes a key and value
 * and makes an entry with key, value.  NOTE: There cannot be two entries with the same key.
 * It also needs a remove method which takes a key and, if that key exists in the arraylist, removes that item.
 * Void return on `remove`.
